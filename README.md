# simple-boilerplate
Simple Boilerplate is for HTML/CSS, Javascript, and JQuery projects. It has been setup with a live server so that you can see live changes with every save.

### Getting Started
You can either fork or clone this repo.
```
npm install simple-live-boilerplate
```

### Starting Live Server
1. Navigate to the root folder (example, `simple-boilerplate/`)
2. Run `live-server`
3. Let it up open a local environment in your browser
4. Any changes in your files related to `index.html` will be seen in your browser

### Deployment to Github Pages
1. In your github repository settings, do the following:

2. Go to your browser and check out `http://<YourUsername>.github.io/<yourRepoName>`. Give it a few minutes to see your changes!

### Deployment to Heroku
If you want to deploy to Heroku, it would require you to write a small simple server that would serve the `index.html` file as an entry point. This boilerplate isn't setup for that, but feel free to add it yourself!
